LinkFixerFixerBot
=================

A really (read really really) annoying reddit bot that stalks LinkFixerBot and 'unfixes' it's comments causing a full on bot-war.  
Made in 30 minutes just entirely for lulz. Haters gonna hate XD.  
Powered by h2s's reddit api wrapper.  

#Setup
1. Make sure you got PHP & MySQL set up. (if you don't know how, please, stahp. go home. this is no place for you.)  
2. Execute the SQL file in your MySQL database  
3. Set up config.php (speaks for it self)  
4. Make a cronjob running every minute running linkfixerfixer.php  
5. PROF-no. not gonna do that. I'M TIRED OF SAYING THAT, OKAY?!?!? Enjoy. Spam as much as you can and get those downvotes you glorious bastard.
